              Puppy's First Style
              %p Puppes should be slowly introduced to grooming so they have a positive first experience. Your puppy will be bathed, towel-dried, and gently blow-dried. They will be introduced to our styling tools, and if tolerated, will get a light trim of the eyes, feet, and sanitary regions. Most puppies will be readyf or a full style by their second appointment.

              Special Needs Styling
              %p Sometimes dogs need some extra TLC to make them as comfortable as possible. This applies to dogs with behavioral issues, very nervous dogs, or major health issues requiring a second hand. Please note that on occasion a groom may need to be completed over two or more sessions for the safety and comfort of your loved one.
